# Flixster
Blake Eller's Flixster project
Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

üìù `NOTE - PASTE PART 2 SNIPPET HERE:` Paste the README template for part 2 of this assignment here at the top. This will show a history of your development process, which users stories you completed and how your app looked and functioned at each step.
### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)

- [X] (8pts) Expose details of movie (ratings using RatingBar, popularity, and synopsis) in a separate activity.
- [X] (2pts) Allow video posts to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView.

#### BONUS

- [ ] Trailers for popular movies are played automatically when the movie is selected (1 point).
- [ ] When clicking on a popular movie (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars) the video should be played immediately.
- [ ] Less popular videos rely on the detailed page should show an image preview that can initiate playing a YouTube video.
- [ ] Add a play icon overlay to popular movies to indicate that the movie can be played (1 point).
- [ ] Apply the popular ButterKnife annotation library to reduce view boilerplate. (1 point)
- [ ] Add a rounded corners for the images using the Glide transformations. (1 point)

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I accidentally added a few extra letters a library i was supposed to include, and when i went to post my error as a question on the discussion board,
i forgot to actually hit "post" and went to bed without actually posting the question, and didn't notice until late the next day.
Everything else was fine though.

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories
`TODO://` In the **User Stories section below**, add an `x` in the `-[ ]` like this `- [x]` for any user story you complete. (üö´ Remove this paragraph after after checking off completed user stories)

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [X] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [ ] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [ ] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.
